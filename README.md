# Yes-Prof-Typora-Theme
a fork of the in-built Typora Github theme, with a single modification for academic purposes (writing mathematical proofs).

## The only change

There is no way to show in typical markdown something like this:

```
    1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
        1.1. consectetur adipiscing elit,
        1.2. sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
    2. Ut enim ad minim veniam, 
        2.1 quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
```

So I modified the css file to do this automatically with numbered nested lists.

## How to install
The whole folder is to copied whole and put into ``~/Library/Application Support/abnerworks.Typora/themes``

## Sources
Everything in this is from Typora's in built theme github with the only modification being some additional lines in the css file. As such, I'm following their license from https://github.com/typora/typora-theme-gallery/blob/gh-pages/assets/css/github.css:
